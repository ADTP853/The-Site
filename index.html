                    Welcome to my domain, it's good to see you.
                    </br><br>
                    Are you seeking to digitally improve your business image, promoting
                    yourself by standing out from the crowd, whilst maintaining a professional and personal feel? 
                    </br><br>
                    Then you're in the right place!
                    </br><br>
                    Whether it's updating your current site or the need to build one from scratch.
                    Prepare to be excited for your fresh feeling website, that let's the world know
                    who you are. Have a browse around my site and be sure to check out my
                    <a class=me href="about me.html"><em>"About Me"</em></a> page to have the front foot
                    in getting to know who you will be working with.

                    WHAT I CAN OFFER YOU
                    </br><br>
                    So you might be wondering what exactly I can do, well...
                    </br><br>
                    ...there's a few things actually. Firstly I can fix any problems you may 
                    experience with your current website, be that a site built from scratch or a 
                    template site. If there's something you feel needs adding such as an image/video,
                    an email subscriber list or just simply a change of colour here and there, well I
                    can do that too. I can also build you a brand new website using 
                    HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT AND JQUERY programming languages.
                    </br><br>
                    If this sounds like what you need, then be sure to get <a class=me href="Contact.html">
                    <em>"In Contact"</em></a>. When we have our chat, my aim is to take hold of your 
                    vision and digitally build it.

                    It's always a good idea to know who you are working with...</br><br>
        
                    ...so hello, I'm Alec. I'm married to an amazing photographer who's name is Bry. 
                    No children just yet but we do parent two furry huskies. I served 12 years in the British
                    Army, after which I decided to have a change. That change was
                    to make a career out of my interest in coding, whilst being location free.
                    </br><br>
                    I have links to my <a class="me" href="#foot">"social media"</a> platforms if you wanted to
                    see my adventures and work. Then if you wanted to know a little more of my story check out
                    my <a class="me" href="About me.html">"About Me"</a> page.
                </div>
            </p> 
        </div>
        <div class="content two last">

                <img src="CSS/me.jpg" alt="Alec" class="pic4">

                    <a class="me" href="Contact.html">CONTACT DETAILS</a>
                    </br><br>
                    At this point, I hope you have grasped a slight feel of who I am and what I can 
                    offer you. So let's take the next step and start talking about what it is you need 
                    from me.
                    </br><br>
                    I don't use my social media platforms for communicating over our projects so check
                    out my <a class="me" href="Contact.html">"Contact Details"</a> page to get us in touch.

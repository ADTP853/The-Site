                    Hey, so let's get into what it is I do,
                    </br><br>
                    But firstly let's be clear from the get go, I am a web developer not a web designer. There is, believe it or not, a difference 
                    between the two in that a web designer (not me) has an artistic eye when it comes to building websites/site content, although
                    they may not possess the skills to build their designs. Whereas a web developer (100% this is me) has the tool set to build
                    websites/site content but may not possess the artistic eye for that classy style.
                    </br><br>
                    You may be worrying at this point but worry no further, when we work on your projects we discuss all angles, which includes how
                    your project will look. If you, like me, don't possess that artitistic eye, I can help bring a web designer into our 
                    project or if you already have one in mind, great! Regardless, this will not be a major issue when we work together.
                    </br><br>
                    Scroll down to find the three main sections I predominantly work in. Each section links to my email specifically for that
                    line of work. Can't see the section that relates to what you're after? That's ok, i'm not limited to these skill sets and 
                    work on various projects outside of these sections. So hit my email icon at the bottom of the page and let's talk about
                    your unique project.

                        <h4>Custom Coding</h4>
                        You have an idea for your website that you have maybe seen elsewhere and thought, <i>'Hey!, that would look
                        so good on my website'</i>'. Or maybe your idea is completely from scratch and you're now thinking <i>'Hey!, how do
                        I place my great idea on my website?'</i>. Well, in both of these cases, the most common thing holding
                        these ideas from coming to life, is your templated website. It just doesn't offer the content you need for
                        your idea. 
                        </br><br>
                        Whilst it's possible to add custom coded content to your templated website, the only problem is you either 
                        don't know how to code or simply do not have the time to learn the code needed. 
                        </br><br>
                        I have talked with entrepreneurs like you, about their ideas and together we have built some interesting 
                        content for their websites. If you have an idea looming for your website, let's get in touch and make your
                        vision a reality here, 
                        <a class="me me1" alt="email" href="mailto:Alec@ontheroadcoder.com?subject=Enquiry: Custom coding"  target="_top">@&lt;/onTheRoadCoder&gt;</a>

                        <h4>Websites</h4>
                        A great way of keeping our empires alive in a rapidly evolving technological world is by having a stand out website that shows
                        the world who we are.
                        </br><br>
                        Now it's true I can build websites from scratch as I do here at &lt;/onTheRoadCoder&gt;, but unless you have coding experience, making
                        changes further down the line and general website maintenance could prove difficult. Of course you could come back to me or other web 
                        developers but a better option still is to use a templated website. 
                        </br><br>
                        Yes I did just say that.
                        </br><br>
                        What it comes down to is your website's purpose, let's take &lt;/onTheRoadCoder&gt; for example. Here I don't use a templated 
                        website as I have the tools to build and maintain it keeping my running costs low. If you have coding experience, or you don't but
                        intend to not make regular updates to your website in terms of style / content creation, then a custom coded website could be for you.
                        </br><br>
                        If you have little or no coding experience but want complete control of being able to quickly update how your website looks, then a templated
                        website is the ticket. I can help build your website on a template like Wordpress, Squarespace, etc or from scratch, so if you're in
                        need of a brand new website, let's talk about it here 
                        <a class="me me2" alt="email" href="mailto:Alec@ontheroadcoder.com?subject=Enquiry: Website"  target="_top">@&lt;/onTheRoadCoder&gt;</a>

                        <h4>General fixes & touch ups</h4>
                        Occasionaly, like anything in life, websites need a bit of TLC to keep them on track. 
                        </br><br>
                        Are you looking at your website and thinking <i>'that picture is good but would maybe look better on the right'</i> or<i> 'I think my 
                        paragraphs need more space between them'?</i> We all invest lots of our time into creating our perfect website and then a little
                        later down the line, our OCD kicks in and we want to make minor changes. Only problem is those minor changes can take up more of
                        our valuable time with potentially still being stuck at square one.
                        </br><br>
                        If you have a few changes here and there to make on your website, but don't have the time or you're not getting anwhere, let's
                        talk here

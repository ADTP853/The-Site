                Yes, I build websites. It's the most rewarding part of my job, building your idea from
                scratch and seeing you smiling at the result. 
                </br><br>
                I build sites using HTML5, CSS3, JS & JQ programming languages. Combined, they make for asthetically
                pleasing interactive sites that draw traffic in. If you'ld like to know a little more about what each 
                language offers, hit the drop down bar. I help with setting up your domain names and setting up on a live 
                server so that the world can see your thing.

                    HTML5: Is the latest version of Hyper Text Markup language. Essentially, HTML is the spine of your
                    web site, the part that keeps it all together. HTML allows developers to tell the computer what they
                    want to show and when. Sort of like a translator.
                    </br><br>
                    CSS3: Is the latest version of Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is the difference between a site looking 
                    plain black and white, to a site looking bright and full of colour.
                    </br><br>
                    JS: JavaScript is still fairly new to the coding world. It allows your site to be interactive. For 
                    example, you can create a an email subscription list.
                    </br><br>
                    JQ: JQuery isn't a language a such. It's a programme built to support JS and as such, allows your page 
                    to load faster and run more smoothly. So it's a nice to have.

                I enjoy building new websites just as much as you enjoy having them. I make the whole process 
                a fun experience for both of us starting off with the <a href="Contact.html">"Intial Contact"</a>.
                We talk about the kind of site you envisage and what content you would like it to have.
                After our talk, I provide you with a draft of how it will both look and run. This is a big step in
                the building process as it gives you a more visual insight, allowing you to make the minor, or major
                adjustments. 
                </br><br>
                Then I build your dream.

                There is the odd occassion when we take a second glance at our sites and have the realisation it needs
                just that extra touch to keep it ahead of the game.
                </br><br>
                Put simply, you don't need to build a new website. I can help add to your current one.
                </br><br>
                There are many reasons why you may need a change, whatever yours is, be sure to
                <a class="me" href="Contact.html">"Get In Touch"</a> , and we can talk about your needs.
                </br>
                Common needs for change:
                <ul>
                    <li>You need a custom code for your template site</li>
                    <li>Have seen something elsewhere that would suit your own</li>
                    <li>Current offers have changed/limited special offers available</li>
                    <li>Change of business logo/colour scheme</li>
                    <li>Site has remained unchanged for 5+ years</li>
                </ul>

                    It's frustrating when everyday problems occur and sadly, the digital world has these same everyday
                    dramas, alongside the added threat of cyber security risks. There's nothing worse than when your 
                    clients are trying to work with a non-user friendly site especially when everything seemed to be
                    working before.
                    </br><br>
                    Just think for a moment, what would a client do if whilst browsing your site the 
                    page jumped irrationally, links they clicked on took them to unxpected places and that email contact 
                    you set up, well it doesn't work. At what point would you recognise something wasn't right?
                    </br><br>
                    As well as common problem solving, I also offer an aftercare package for those I work with. This
                    entails the checking of your site and it's running capability with a monthly update. For more information
                    feel free to <a class="me" href="Contact.html">"Get In Touch"</a>
